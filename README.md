## What's it used for?

You know when you try to download a file off the internet, or have a super important email and want to make sure nothing happened to it along the way to your router, or even tampered with while you were away? Well, checksums are basically a fingerprint for a file on your computer, and is extremely unique (not %100 percent however) to your specific file. Attempting to keep the same fingerprint for a file after it was modified, is EXTREMELY difficult.

SO... when you download launchcodes.exe from a website, look for a hash or something that says something like: MD5, SHA-1, or SHA-256. Those are hashes used to add a fingerprint to your file. Use those to compare against the copy locally on your computer, to make sure nothing bad happened to them.

### Java is required!
